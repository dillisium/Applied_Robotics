Temporary Solution: Use wlan2 for Downloads
Route Traffic Through wlan2 Add a temporary default route to prioritize wlan2 for internet traffic:

bash
Copy code
sudo ip route add default via 192.168.171.254 dev wlan2
This temporarily overrides the eth0 default route, allowing internet traffic to go through wlan2.

Download the Library Use your package manager (e.g., apt, pip) to download the required library:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install <library_name>
Or for Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip3 install <library_name>
Restore the Original Default Route After the download is complete, remove the temporary route and restore the original one:

bash
Copy code
sudo ip route del default via 192.168.171.254 dev wlan2
Confirm that the original route is restored:

bash
Copy code
ip route show
Download Without Altering Default Routes
If you prefer not to change the default route for all traffic, you can specify the wlan2 interface directly for downloads:

Using curl or wget:
Use --interface to specify wlan2:
bash
Copy code
curl --interface wlan2 -O http://example.com/library.tar.gz
wget --bind-address=192.168.171.21 http://example.com/library.tar.gz
Using Pythonâ€™s pip:
Run pip with the --proxy option and set a local proxy bound to wlan2 (requires additional setup). Alternatively:

Temporarily set a route for pip using the wlan2 IP:
bash
Copy code
pip3 install <library_name> --timeout=60
Persistent Download Solution
If you frequently need to download libraries through wlan2:

Add a specific rule to route traffic for certain destinations through wlan2:

bash
Copy code
sudo ip route add 0.0.0.0/1 via 192.168.171.254 dev wlan2
This routes all internet-bound traffic temporarily through wlan2.

Remove the rule after downloading:

bash
Copy code
sudo ip route del 0.0.0.0/1 via 192.168.171.254 dev wlan2
Verification
After applying any of these methods, verify that downloads are using wlan2:

bash
Copy code
ip route get 8.8.8.8
This will display the route used to reach the destination (e.g., via 192.168.171.254 dev wlan2).
